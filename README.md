## Background

In this Jupyter Notebook, I use Python and Pandas quantitative analytical tools to identify the top-performing portfolios based on volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. Through the analysis and visualization of these key metrics, I achieved three main objectives:

* Read in and Wrangle Returns Data - Preparing the Data
* Determine Success of Each Portfolio - Conducting Quantitative Analysis
* Choose and evaluate custom portfolio - Building a Custom Portfolio (including data preparation and quantitative analysis)
